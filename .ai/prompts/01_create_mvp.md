You are an AI assistant tasked with helping create a document outlining a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an educational flashcard application. Your goal is to engage in a conversation to prepare this document based on the given template.

Please follow these instructions to complete the task:

1. Analyze the given template carefully. Pay attention to the structure and the type of information required in each section.

2. Ask user questions to clarify and gain deeper understanding about the scope of this project.

2. Based on your analysis, prepare to generate content for each section of the document. Consider the following guidelines:
   - The "Main Problem" section should clearly articulate the issue the MVP aims to solve.
   - The "Minimum Set of Features" should list essential functionalities that directly address the main problem.
   - The "What is NOT included in the MVP" section should mention advanced features or expansions that are deliberately excluded from the initial version.
   - The "Success Criteria" should define measurable goals that indicate the MVP's effectiveness.

3. As you generate content, maintain consistency with the original language (Polish) and style of the template.

4. Ensure that your generated content aligns with the concept of proposed and described application.

5. Format your response to match the structure of the given template, using "###" for main section headers.

6. Your final output should only include the completed document, formatted as per the template. Do not include any explanations, notes, or additional comments outside the document structure.

When generating .ai/mvp.md document, begin your response with the header "### Główny problem" and end it with the last success criterion.
